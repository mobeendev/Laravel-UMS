This is a Web Application developed in Laravel Framework. The purpose of developing this project is just to show my understanding about the Laravel framework .

This web application is a User Management System with following stories.

- A person can register as Admin
- 	Admin can login into the system
- 	Admin can add users  
	- a user has following attributes 
	- first_name.
	- last_name
	- gender
	- city
	- Admin can view the User
	- Admin can delete users from groups.
	- When admin deletes a user, his/her joined group will be detached but user will not be removed from the DB.
- 	Amin can attach users to a group they aren’t already part of.
- 	Admin can remove users from a group.
- 	Admin can create groups.
- 	A group has ‘name’ attribute
- 	Admin can view the groups with all the user’s in that group on detail screen

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
